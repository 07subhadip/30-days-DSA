## 📝 Review Plan:

- **1. Revisit Challenging Problems:**

    - Go back to the problems that you found hard in the past 13 days.
    - Break them down again, and understand why they were challenging.

- **2. Time Your Solutions:**

    - Practice solving previously solved problems within a time limit to improve speed and confidence.

- **3. Solidify Concepts:**

    - Review your notes, and revisit tricky concepts like traversal in trees, stack/queue operations, and hash functions.
    - Make sure you're comfortable with both basic and advanced versions of each data structure.

- **4. Visualize & Analyze:**

    - For each data structure, create visual diagrams or examples to better understand how they operate.
