# Solution : Two Pointer

We use two pointers 
𝑖
 and 
𝑗
, initially pointing to the start and end of the array respectively. Each time, we swap the elements at 
𝑖
 and 
𝑗
, then move 
𝑖
 forward and 
𝑗
 backward, until 
𝑖
 and 
𝑗
 meet.

The time complexity is 
𝑂
(
𝑛
)
, where 
𝑛
 is the length of the array. The space complexity is 
𝑂
(
1
)
.
