# Solution : Counting

We first determine whether the length of the two strings is equal. If they are not equal, the characters in the two strings must be different, so return `false`.

Otherwise, we use a hash table or an array of length $26$ to record the number of times each character appears in the string $s$, and then traverse the other string $t$. Each time we traverse a character, we subtract the number of times the corresponding character appears in the hash table by one. If the number of times after subtraction is less than $0$, the number of times the character appears in the two strings is different, return `false`. If after traversing the two strings, all the character counts in the hash table are $0$, it means that the characters in the two strings appear the same number of times, return `true`.

The time complexity is $O(n)$, the space complexity is $O(C)$, where $n$ is the length of the string; and $C$ is the size of the character set, which is $C=26$ in this problem.
