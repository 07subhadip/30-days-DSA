# Solution : Dynamic Programming

We define $f[i][j]$ to represent whether the string $s[i..j]$ is a palindrome, initially $f[i][j] = true$.

Next, we define variables $k$ and $mx$, where $k$ represents the starting position of the longest palindrome, and $mx$ represents the length of the longest palindrome. Initially, $k = 0$, $mx = 1$.

Considering $f[i][j]$, if $s[i] = s[j]$, then $f[i][j] = f[i + 1][j - 1]$; otherwise, $f[i][j] = false$. If $f[i][j] = true$ and $mx < j - i + 1$, then we update $k = i$, $mx = j - i + 1$.

Since $f[i][j]$ depends on $f[i + 1][j - 1]$, we need to ensure that $i + 1$ is before $j - 1$, so we need to enumerate $i$ from large to small, and enumerate $j$ from small to large.

The time complexity is $O(n^2)$, and the space complexity is $O(n^2)$. Here, $n$ is the length of the string $s$.
