## Approach Explanation: Add Two Numbers (Linked Lists)

### Problem Summary:
We are given two **non-empty** linked lists, each representing a non-negative integer, with digits stored in **reverse order**. Our task is to add the two numbers represented by the linked lists and return the result as a linked list.

### Approach:
We can solve this problem by simulating how we manually add numbers digit by digit, starting from the least significant digit (rightmost digit).

### Steps:

1. **Create a Dummy Node:**
   - We create a `dummy` node to hold the result linked list. This simplifies the logic and helps manage the head of the new list.

2. **Initialize Variables:**
   - A variable `carry` is initialized to 0 to store the carry value for digits that add up to more than 9.

3. **Iterate Through Both Lists:**
   - We iterate through both `l1` and `l2` simultaneously. For each iteration:
     - Add the values of the current nodes from both lists (if they exist) to the carry.
     - Compute the new digit (sum modulo 10) and the new carry (sum divided by 10).
     - Create a new node with the computed digit and link it to the result list.
   - If one of the lists is shorter, treat the missing nodes as 0.

4. **Handle Remaining Carry:**
   - After the loop, if there is still a carry (i.e., the sum of the last digits was more than 9), create a new node with the value of the carry and link it to the result.

5. **Return the Result:**
   - The result is stored in the linked list starting from the node next to `dummy`.

### Example:

Consider the following input:
- `l1 = [2, 4, 3]` (representing the number 342 in reverse order)
- `l2 = [5, 6, 4]` (representing the number 465 in reverse order)

- Step 1: Add `2 + 5 = 7`. Carry = 0.
- Step 2: Add `4 + 6 = 10`. Write down 0 and carry 1.
- Step 3: Add `3 + 4 + carry 1 = 8`. No carry left.

The final linked list is `[7, 0, 8]`, representing the number 807 (which is the sum of 342 and 465).

### Time Complexity:
- The time complexity is **O(max(n1, n2))**, where `n1` and `n2` are the lengths of the two linked lists.

### Space Complexity:
- The space complexity is **O(max(n1, n2))** because the result list will have at most one extra node for the carry.

### Edge Cases:
1. If both input numbers are 0, return `[0]`.
2. Handle cases where the two lists have different lengths.
